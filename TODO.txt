TOP PRIORITIES

#01:  add battle collisions that stop all movement, but let the character go in opposite directions, or bounce the player (maybe a little both)
#02:  platforms
#03:  add big background that moves, then when within canvas size, character moves (switch between the 2 modes)
#04:  add npc following overworld
#05:  add enemy overworld
#06:  add overworld interacting
#07:  add overworld and battle dialogue
#08:  add battle platforms
#09:  add overworld sword
#10:  optimize code using switch statements, canvas imaging thing, and others:  https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_performance.asp
#11:  add menu
#12:  add enemy battle
#13:  add enemy battle ai
#14:  add save files (probably need electron or node.js (included in electron))
#15:  Tweak overworld sword animation
#16:  Add battle animations (use procedural animation)

Other things to implement on a later date

  music (gotta make it first)
  Neural network (ouch)
  Procedural music/attacks?
  Making music sync with attacks by training neural network to reconize beats and sync
  Render Pixelization on side or before game is drawn?
  Use hashs? for what?
  In overworld, keep atatck animation going in single direction without a way to stop
  Open world? make an enemy ai that will secretly fight in background
  Have secret room/way to fight editor or kwack as joke
  Dynamic frame rate
  Air dash that can be aimed and rotated
  Make "one respawn" powerup where you place it somewhere during battle and only respawn once
  Make quick fall if has double jump available
  walls in battle should bounce player in opposite direction with the same speed (maybe, we also have the wall sliding ability)
  In Media.js, maybe change currFrame to something with frameRate()
  Player and enemy should attack the same way, player can choose different attacks and aim at enemy
  Make sword get more red the more you kill, maybe more blue the more pacifist you are
  Add unlocking abilities (both pacifist and genocide routes have these)
  Add unlocking attacks (only genocide)
  Remember direction character was in during overworld after battle
  Make dash frameRate baes like everything else
  Fix dash activating if enough time passed the moment you hit the ground
  maybe make visor shading more visible
  Make battle character bounce when velocitY is greater than like 20 or something
  Find way to calculate exact moment when colliding with something, only when going at extreme speeds
  Only change color of current frame?
  make everything not frame based, make up lost frames

Maybe add libraries? 
(depends on if its just quality of life (add), or if it will do work for me (want satisfaction of doing it myself))
