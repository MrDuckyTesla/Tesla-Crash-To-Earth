TOP PRIORITIES

#01:  add big background that moves, then when within canvas size, character moves (switch between the 2 modes)
#02:  redo ALL sprites, and add more characters. maybe even implement a customization system
#03:  add npc following overworld
#04:  add enemy overworld
#05:  add overworld interacting
#06:  add overworld and battle dialogue
#07:  add overworld sword
#08:  optimize code using switch statements, canvas imaging thing, and others:  https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_performance.asp
#09:  add menu
#10:  add enemy battle ai
#11:  add save files (probably need electron or node.js (included in electron))
#12:  Add battle animations (using procedural animation)

Other things to implement on a later date

  music (gotta make it first)
  Neural network (ouch)
  Procedural music/attacks?
  Making music sync with attacks by training neural network to reconize beats and sync
  Render Pixelization on side or before game is drawn?
  Use hashs to store images and skip CORS policy. maybe just use electron
  In overworld, keep attack animation going in single direction without a way to stop
  Open world? make an enemy ai that will secretly fight in background
  Have secret room/way to fight editor or kwack as joke
  Air dash that can be aimed and rotated
  Make "one respawn" powerup where you place it somewhere during battle and only respawn once
  In Media.js, maybe change currFrame to something with frameRate()
  Player and enemy should attack the same way, player can choose different attacks and aim at enemy
  Make sword get more red the more you kill, maybe more blue the more pacifist you are
  Add unlocking abilities (both pacifist and genocide routes have these)
  Add unlocking attacks (only genocide)
  maybe make visor shading more visible
  Only change color of current frame?
  make everything not frame based, make up lost frames
  make player get darker red during genocide
  local coop before networking
  add private variables
  battle character should be bounced off wall if going too fast, also should act like overworld character if going slow towards wall and on ground
  battle character should hit ground before getting launched upwards
  Make sure sprites are using right foot first every animation
  animation system might need a variable that determines if a full animation should be played
