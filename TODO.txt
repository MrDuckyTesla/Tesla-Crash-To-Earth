Other things to implement on a later date

  music (gotta make it first)
  Neural network (ouch)
  Procedural music/attacks?
  Making music sync with attacks by training neural network to reconize beats and sync
  Render Pixelization on side or before game is drawn?
  Use hashs to store images and skip CORS policy. maybe just use electron
  In overworld, keep attack animation going in single direction without a way to stop
  Open world? make an enemy ai that will secretly fight in background
  Have secret room/way to fight editor or kwack as joke
  Air dash that can be aimed and rotated
  Make "one respawn" powerup where you place it somewhere during battle and only respawn once
  In Media.js, maybe change currFrame to something with frameRate()
  Player and enemy should attack the same way, player can choose different attacks and aim at enemy
  Make sword get more red the more you kill, maybe more blue the more pacifist you are
  Add unlocking abilities (both pacifist and genocide routes have these)
  Add unlocking attacks (only genocide)
  maybe make visor shading more visible
  Only change color of current frame?
  make everything not frame based, make up lost frames
  make player get darker red during genocide
  local coop before networking
  add private variables
  Make sure sprites are using right foot first every animation
  Make rotating battle box, may have to use sin and cos shenanigans
  make walls have slip or wall climb variables
  Make objects that move the player only
  Make objects that move on their own
  Make objects that act as launch pads
  Make objects that dissapear after a certain amount of time
  Maybe add to x or y in overworld when switching state of moving background (current system is off by a few pixels, low priority as is unnoticeable)
  TRY to get image.width and image.height working, could get rid of multiple variables
  add funny dialogue if the player spam skips npc dialogue
