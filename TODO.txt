TOP PRIORITIES

#01:  add battle collisions that stop all movement, but let the character go in opposite directions, or bounce the player (maybe a little both)
USE RECTANGLE FOR COLLISION OR LINES ^^^^^
#02:  platforms
#03:  add big background that moves, then when within canvas size, character moves (switch between the 2 modes)
#04:  redo ALL sprites, and add more characters. maybe even implement a customization system
#04:  add npc following overworld
#05:  add enemy overworld
#06:  add overworld interacting
#07:  add overworld and battle dialogue
#08:  add overworld sword
#09:  optimize code using switch statements, canvas imaging thing, and others:  https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_performance.asp
#10:  add menu
#11:  add enemy battle ai
#12:  add save files (probably need electron or node.js (included in electron))
#13:  Tweak overworld sword animation
#14:  Add battle animations (use procedural animation)

Other things to implement on a later date

  music (gotta make it first)
  Neural network (ouch)
  Procedural music/attacks?
  Making music sync with attacks by training neural network to reconize beats and sync
  Render Pixelization on side or before game is drawn?
  Use hashs to store images and skip CORS policy
  In overworld, keep attack animation going in single direction without a way to stop
  Open world? make an enemy ai that will secretly fight in background
  Have secret room/way to fight editor or kwack as joke
  Air dash that can be aimed and rotated
  Make "one respawn" powerup where you place it somewhere during battle and only respawn once
  In Media.js, maybe change currFrame to something with frameRate()
  Player and enemy should attack the same way, player can choose different attacks and aim at enemy
  Make sword get more red the more you kill, maybe more blue the more pacifist you are
  Add unlocking abilities (both pacifist and genocide routes have these)
  Add unlocking attacks (only genocide)
  Make dash frameRate baes like everything else
  maybe make visor shading more visible
  Find way to calculate exact moment when colliding with something, only when going at extreme speeds
  Only change color of current frame?
  make everything not frame based, make up lost frames
  Maybe look at this? https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/
  make player get darker red during genocide
  local coop before networking
  add private variables
  Exponential slide (faster over time)
  battle character should be bounced off wall if going too fast, also should act like overworld character if going slow towards wall and on ground
  battle character should hit ground before getting launched upwards
  battle character should bonk head on ceiling
  Make sure sprites are using right fooot first every animation

Maybe add libraries? 
(depends on if its just quality of life (add), or if it will do work for me (want satisfaction of doing it myself))
