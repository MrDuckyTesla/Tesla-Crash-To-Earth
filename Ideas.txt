Random ideas that could implement for fun?

Procedural music/attacks?
Making music sync with attacks by training neural network to reconize beats and sync
Render Pixelization on side or before game is drawn?
Use hashs? for what?
In overworld, keep atatck animation going in single direction without a way to stop
Open world? make an enemy ai that will secretly fight in background
Have secret room/way to fight editor or kwack as joke
Dynamic frame rate
Air dash that can be aimed and rotated
Make "one respawn" powerup where you place it somewhere during battle and only respawn once
Make quick fall if has double jump available
walls in battle should bounce player in opposite direction with the same speed (maybe, we also have the wall sliding ability)
